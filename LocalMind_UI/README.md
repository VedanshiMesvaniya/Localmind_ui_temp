# Local Mind UI

Local Mind UI is a Vite + React chat dashboard with a dark/light theme, sidebar navigation, settings, documents, and markdown-based assistant responses.

This project currently uses static demo data so the UI works end to end without a backend. The code is already structured so you can replace the demo layer with live API data later.

## What This Project Includes

- Chat interface with a sidebar and conversation view
- Recent chat list with rename and delete actions
- Settings page with theme selection and model controls
- Documents page for future document-related features
- Theme support for dark, light, and system-style behavior
- Markdown rendering for assistant responses

## Requirements

Before running the app, install:

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm, which comes with Node.js

If you do not have Node.js installed, download it from:

- https://nodejs.org

After installing Node.js, open a terminal and verify it:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Setup Steps

Follow these steps from a fresh machine or a fresh clone.

### 1. Clone Or Open The Project

If you are cloning it from git:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd LocalMind_UI
```

If the project is already on your machine, just open the project folder in your terminal.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install everything listed in `package.json`:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start The Development Server

Run the Vite dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the local URL shown in the terminal, usually:

```bash
http://localhost:5173
```

### 4. Build For Production

When you want a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

### 5. Preview The Production Build

To preview the built app locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

### 6. Run Lint Checks

To check code quality:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Project Flow

1. `src/main.jsx` boots the app, loads fonts, and wraps React in the error boundary.
2. `src/App.jsx` sets up routes and mounts the main layout.
3. `src/components/Layout.jsx` initializes the app and applies the selected theme.
4. `src/store/store.js` holds the app state with Zustand.
5. `src/services/api.js` returns static demo data for now.
6. Components and pages read from the store and render the UI.

## Data Flow

- `initApp()` loads chats, messages, documents, settings, and overview data.
- `sendPrompt()` adds the user message and a demo assistant response.
- `newChat()` creates a new chat and switches to it.
- `renameChat()` updates a chat title in the sidebar.
- `deleteChat()` removes a chat and keeps the UI in a valid state.
- `updateSettings()` saves theme and model settings locally.

## Where Live API Data Will Connect Later

The app is static for now, but these functions are already marked as the API hook points:

- `getOverview()` in `src/services/api.js`
- `getChats()` in `src/services/api.js`
- `getMessages(chatId)` in `src/services/api.js`
- `sendMessage(chatId, message)` in `src/services/api.js`
- `createChat(title)` in `src/services/api.js`
- `getDocuments()` in `src/services/api.js`
- `saveSettings(payload)` in `src/services/api.js`
- `getSettings()` in `src/services/api.js`
