          The first load uses static demo data so the UI works immediately. When
          you connect your backend later, the live API responses can replace the
          placeholder data without changing the component tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the chat page for the main conversation flow, the documents page
          for uploads and file metadata, and the settings page for API
          configuration later.
